A general description of the YFT case study and associated operating model is provided to aid workshop participants in the development and application of stock assessments using their desired assessment package. Recent yellowfin tuna stock assessments performed for the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), as well as supplemental papers that describe the Spatial Population Model (i.e., the simulation model; Dunn et al., 2020; Dunn et al. 2018) are also provided as background on the workshop webpage and participant materials github repository. The following description aims to provide an overview of the primary assumption and main components of the yellowfin tuna operating model, including spatial configuration, population dynamics, simulated data, and model stochasticity, which should enable each analyst to adequately develop both spatially stratified and spatially aggregated assessments using their modeling platform.
