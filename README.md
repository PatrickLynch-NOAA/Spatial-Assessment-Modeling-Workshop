# Spatial Assessment Modeling Experiment and Workshop
2021 Spatial Assessment Modeling Experiment and 2022 In-Person Workshop

# Background

Many generic assessment platforms utilize common mathematical formulations for single area population models, however, spatial dynamics and associated assumptions are not as uniform. Variability in spatial capabilities among assessment software likely influence the decision-making process for assessment analysts and may impact the resulting interpretation of population status.  Exploring and comparing how analysts familiar with spatial assessment platforms develop spatial models given the capabilities and limitations of the software will help formulate guidance on best practices for spatial stock assessment models, including critical spatial modeling capabilities that should be incorporated into the next generation of generic spatial stock assessment software.

# Experiment Overview

A population dynamics simulation experiment was designed to elicit the available mechanisms (statistical, mathematical, or otherwise) and modeling approaches that are used across a suite of operational spatial stock assessment modeling platforms. By exploring capabilities, differences and similarities among them, this study aims to identify existing limitations and research needs, summarize existing modeling options, and provide guidance on current and future best practices for incorporating spatial processes. The main objectives of the simulation experiment are to:

1.	STUDY OUTCOME #1: Highlight how fundamental differences in each platform influence decisions during each stage of development of a spatial stock assessment model; 

2.	STUDY OUTCOME #2: evaluate within platform performance of spatial and spatially aggregated model configurations; and 

3.	STUDY OUTCOME #3: Conduct comparisons among different categories of spatial configurations (e.g., non-spatial, spatially-implicit, spatially-stratified, and fully spatiotemporal). 

A fine-scale, spatially complex operating model developed with the Spatial Population Model (SPM) and tailored to Indian Ocean yellowfin tuna (YFT; Thunnus albacares) will be utilized to provide realistic simulated pseudo-data that demonstrates realistic patterns of stochasticity and error as real world applications. Stock assessment models developed to fit simulated data will be explored as a research exercise and not intended to replace or supplement existing operational stock assessments for any species or fisheries management organization.

# Key milestones for simulation experiment
1. Simulated YFT pseudo-data (100 datasets) each iteration aggregated at two spatial configurations (single area and five area, 1A and 5A, respectively) will be provided to analysts (no later than June 1, 2021)
1. Analysts develop and apply their chosen assessment platform to a single representative dataset (SRD), i.e. 1 of the 100 datasets, for each of the two spatial configurations  (June 2021 - September 2021)
1. Analysts document their model building decision process at each stage of model development focusing on key points 
1. Analysts outline key limitations and any spatial capabilities they envision being a prerequisite for the next generation of spatial stock assessment models; for example: 
1. Are there analytical options you didnâ€™t have access to, or knowledge about, that you wish you did?
1. Are there analytical options that you did use that you deem a critical component of your spatial analyses?
1. What data (or other) limitations impeded your analysis?
1. Analysts summarize the results of their SRD model application
1. Analysts iteratively apply their SRD model to the remaining 99 datasets without making any structural model changes (i.e., run the SRD model with each of the remaining datasets through a coding loop or similar for each spatial configuration: 1A and 5A) (August 2021 - September 2021)
1. Analysts summarize the results across all 100 model runs  (September 2021)
1. Analysts develop a 30 minute presentation for a 1 hour discussion-based seminar where listeners and presenters can interact to learn about each participants modeling process and decision points (October 2021 - December 2021)
1. Analysts present and participate in the virtual discussion-based seminar series which will highlight the various platforms utilized (October 2021-March 2022)
1. Analysts attend an in-person workshop to continue discussions focused on key components on the next generation of spatial stock assessment model features (2022)
