An Introduction to the Workshop and Experimental Design

# Background

Many generic assessment platforms utilize common mathematical formulations for single area population models. However, for assessment frameworks capable of incorporating spatial structure, the methods and assumptions associated with spatial dynamics are not as uniform. Variability in spatial capabilities among assessment software likely influence the decision-making process for assessment analysts and may impact the resulting interpretation of population status. Additionally, approaches for identifying model misspecification due to spatial structure within spatially aggregated or spatially explicit models have not been well documented. Exploring and comparing how analysts familiar with spatial assessment platforms develop spatial models given the capabilities and limitations of different assessment packages can help formulate guidance on best practices for spatial stock assessment models. Similarly, discussions among researchers across regions and fisheries agencies will enable identification of critical spatial modeling capabilities that should be incorporated into the next generation of generic spatial stock assessment software. This document provides an overview of the Spatial Stock Assessment Methods Workshop and associated simulation experiment, highlighting the overarching aims, scope, and approach to be utilized. 

# Experiment Overview

The main feature of the workshop will be a large scale spatial simulation experiment, which brings together assessment analysts familiar with developing spatial stock assessment models from across the globe. The simulation experiment is designed to elicit feedback on the existing suite of spatial stock assessment packages, while comparing similarities and differences across platforms. By exploring capabilities across spatial assessment models, the study will help summarize existing spatial capabilities, identify existing limitations and research needs, and determine components that need to be incorporated into the next generation of spatial stock assessment models. Additionally, discussions around the model building process undertaken by each analyst will help provide guidance on best practices for developing spatial models, including approaches to identify when spatial models are warranted (e.g., through residual analysis). The main objectives of the simulation experiment are to:

1.	OBJECTIVE #1: Discuss best practices in spatial model development by comparing decision-point analyses performed by each analyst, which will highlight how fundamental differences in each platform influence decisions during each stage of development of a spatial stock assessment model, provide insight into why analysts choose certain spatial functionality, and how goodness of fit is determined in a spatial context;; 

2.	OBJECTIVE #2: Evaluate within platform performance of spatial and spatially aggregated model configurations; and 

3.	OBJECTIVE #3: : Explore general performance across different categories of spatial models (e.g., non-spatial, spatially-implicit, spatially-stratified, and fully spatiotemporal) by comparing bias and precision across the broad categories.

To achieve these goals, a fine-scale, spatially complex operating model developed with the Spatial Population Model (SPM) and tailored to Indian Ocean yellowfin tuna (YFT; Thunnus albacares) will be utilized. The operating model will provide simulated pseudo-data that reflects patterns of stochasticity and observation error, which mimic realistic real world applications. Each analyst will be provided an identical background document on the operating model from which to begin development of their chosen assessment application, including information on population structure, demographic rates, data sources, and error structure. Similarly, a detailed step-by-step guidance document will be provided, which will outline the details that each analyst will be expected to report back to the workshop. Stock assessment models developed to fit simulated data will be explored as a research exercise and will not replace or supplement existing operational stock assessments for any species or fisheries management organization.

We envision three primary stages of model development effort that each analyst will need to document. First, the analysts will be provided a single representative, spatially explicit data set from which they will develop a spatial model and document a decision-point analysis at each stage, including why spatial assumptions were utilized, how the model fit to the data was assessed, and how/why model tweaks were made during this process (Objective #1). Second, the final spatial model will be applied to 100 simulated data sets. Finally, analysts will apply a panmictic (i.e., spatially-aggregated) version of their model to the same data aggregated across the spatial domain (again, to each of the 100 iterations). The authors will then provide brief comparisons of model estimates and data fits across the two parametrizations of their model, as well as, any alternate spatial parametrizations that they wish to develop and discuss (Objective #2). Each analyst group will be expected to provide an approximately one hour virtual seminar highlighting their model framework, walking workshop participants through their decision-point model building approach, illustrating model fits (to both the representative and full 100 data sets), and comparing outputs and residual analysis from their panmictic and spatially explicit models. Specific model results (e.g., time series of area-specific SSB, depletion, recruitment, fishing mortality, and residuals) will also be provided to the workshop hosts in a format specified at the outset, which will allow overarching model comparison to the true population trajectories by model categories (Objective #3). Upon completion of the series of virtual seminars in Fall 2021, an in-person workshop (Spring 2022, location and time TBA) will be held to discuss best practices and salient features of the next generation of spatial models.

# Key milestones for simulation experiment

1. Background documents distributed to each analyst and an introductory webinar held to describe the process and answer questions (~May 2021)
1. Simulated YFT pseudo-data (100 datasets) each iteration aggregated at two spatial configurations (single area and five area, 1A and 5A, respectively) will be provided to analysts (no later than June 1, 2021)
1. Analysts develop and apply their chosen assessment platform to a single representative dataset (SRD), i.e. 1 of the 100 datasets, for each of the two spatial configurations  (June 2021 - September 2021)
- Analysts document their model building decision process at each stage of model development focusing on key points 
- Analysts outline key limitations and any spatial capabilities they envision being a prerequisite for the next generation of spatial stock assessment models; for example: 
- Are there analytical options you didnâ€™t have access to, or knowledge about, that you wish you did?
- Are there analytical options that you did use that you deem a critical component of your spatial analyses?
- What data (or other) limitations impeded your analysis?
1. Analysts summarize the results of their SRD model application
1. Analysts iteratively apply their SRD model to the remaining 99 datasets without making any structural model changes (i.e., run the SRD model with each of the remaining datasets through a coding loop or similar for each spatial configuration: 1A and 5A) (August 2021 - September 2021)
1. Analysts summarize the results across all 100 model runs  (September 2021)
1. Analysts develop a 30 minute presentation for a 1 hour discussion-based seminar where listeners and presenters can interact to learn about each participants modeling process and decision points (October 2021 - December 2021)
1. Analysts present and participate in the virtual discussion-based seminar series which will highlight the various platforms utilized (October 2021-March 2022)
1. Analysts attend an in-person workshop to continue discussions focused on key components on the next generation of spatial stock assessment model features (2022)
